This is my toy repository. 

I just wanted to see how a GitHub repository is created,
and I guess I could have just checked in this README and 
nothing else, but I figured it might as well be at least
somewhat useful.

So, this is Stata code for drawing a picture that I cooked
up years ago, showing that we did have a few years' notice
before the housing bubble burst, and maybe we should have
paid attention.

Or I guess you could argue that this is just another case 
of 20/20 hindsight. Either way, here's the data and the
code that puts us into a picture.
